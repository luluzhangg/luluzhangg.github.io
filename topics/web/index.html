            <br>
            <br>
            Love and forgetting might have carried them
            <br>
            A little further up the mountain side
            <br>
            With night so near, but not much further up.
            <br>
            They must have halted soon in any case
            <br>
            With thoughts of a path back, how rough it was
            <br>
            With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;
            <br>
            When they were halted by a tumbled wall
            <br>
            With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,
            <br>
            Spending what onward impulse they still had
            <br>
            In One last look the way they must not go,
            <br>
            On up the failing path, where, if a stone
            <br>
            Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself;
            <br>
            No footstep moved it. ‘This is all,’ they sighed,
            <br>
            Good-night to woods.’ But not so; there was more.
            <br>
            A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
            <br>
            Across the wall, as near the wall as they.
            <br>
            She saw them in their field, they her in hers.
            <br>
            The difficulty of seeing what stood still,
            <br>
            Like some up-ended boulder split in two,
            <br>
            Was in her clouded eyes; they saw no fear there.
            <br>
            She seemed to think that two thus they were safe.
            <br>
            Then, as if they were something that, though strange,
            <br>
            She could not trouble her mind with too long,
            <br>
            She sighed and passed unscared along the wall.
            <br>
            "This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?"
            <br>
            But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait.
            <br>
            A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
            <br>
            Across the wall as near the wall as they.
            <br>
            This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,
            <br>
            Not the same doe come back into her place.
            <br>
            He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,
            <br>
            As if to ask, "Why don’t you make some motion?
            <br>
            Or give some sign of life? Because you can’t.
            <br>
            I doubt if you’re as living as you look."
            <br>
            Thus till he had them almost feeling dared
            <br>
            To stretch a proffering hand - and a spell-breaking.
            <br>
            Then he too passed unscared along the wall.
            <br>
            Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from.
            <br>
            "This must be all." It was all. Still they stood,
            <br>
            A great wave from it going over them,
            <br>
            As if the earth in one unlooked-for favour
            <br>
            Had made them certain earth returned their love.

            <br>
            <br>
            We were rich and poor.
            We were bought and sold.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were black and white.
            We were young and old.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were life and death.
            We were north and south.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were hand in hand.
            We were foot and mouth.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were good and bad.
            We were war and peace.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were day and night.
            We were man and beast.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were hunger and greed.
            We were water and land.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were empty and full.
            We were lost and found.
            <br>
            <br>
            We had two strings to our bow.
            We were in it together.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were the spitting image.
            We were the doppelganger.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were terrible twins.
            We were happy and sad.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were alter ego.
            We were sane and mad.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were two-faced.
            We were two-a-penny.
            <br>
            <br>
            We spat, ‘Double or quits.’
            We sneered, ‘Double the money.’
            <br>
            <br>
            We liked to two-time.
            We stayed in a twin-town.
            <br>
            <br>
            We led a double life.
            We lived in a two-up-two-down.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were too much.
            We were entwined.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were a right pair.
            We were in two minds.
            <br>
            <br>
            We peered through bifocals.
            We talked in double entendres.
            <br>
            <br>
            We walked double-quick.
            We never wandered.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were a double act.
            We were Morecambe and Wise.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were Laurel and Hardy.
            We were Jekyll and Hyde.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were Romeo and Juliet.
            We were tragedy and comedy.
            <br>
            <br>
            We spoke tête-à-tête.
            We were a carbon copy.
            <br>
            <br>
            We dreamt in a double bed.
            We were fluently bilingual.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were in two minds.
            We were never single.
            <br>
            <br>
            We drove on dual carriageways.
            We insisted on equal pay.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were twinned; we were mated.
            We loved and we hated.
            <br>
            <br>
            We could not be separated.
            We could not be separated.
