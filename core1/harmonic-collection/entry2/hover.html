<h1>Coral Bleaching</h1>
<div>Coral reefs are one of the largest ecosystems on Earth with the highest biodiversity,
  supporting <span class="longway">25%</span> of marine life and boosting coastal economies globally through tourism,
  fishing, and recreation. Coral reefs, along with coastlines, are major defence mechanisms
  for coastal countries, to shelter them from storms and erosion.
</div>

<div> However, with the <span class="rise">rise</span> in global sea temperatures and levels,
  other factors such as salinity and acidity of the ocean waters have changed too,
  this causes a huge problem for coral reefs as they require very specific conditions in order to grow properly.
  The effects of global warming, over-fishing, erosion from tourism and runoff from man-made factories also
  causes a phenomenon called <span class="coral">“coral bleaching”</span>, by which corals lose their colour as they expel a microalgae
  called zooxanthellae that are found within their tissue cells. “Bleached” corals become more vulnerable to
  diseases and death, over the last decade more than <span class="longway">50%</span> of coral reefs have died and the percentage is expected
  to rise to <span class="longway">90%</span> by 2050.
