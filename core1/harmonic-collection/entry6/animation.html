  <p>No matter where we live, the ocean influences <em>all of us.</em> In turn our actions, with over 7 billion of us, add up to influence the ocean.
The ocean provides us with basics, like oxygen and fresh water, and the ocean feeds us. Even if we do not eat seafood, fishmeal is used to feed poultry and pork as well as to organically fertilize crops for millennia.
The ocean allows humans to trade, and gives many of us jobs in <b>fisheries, trade, shipping, tourism and travel.</b>
<br>
<br>
The ocean also is a source of <b>minerals, energy resources, and medicines.</b>
It provides us with the opportunity for ocean sports and activities. It can help to inspire people, like a muse, or to help people relax, like a spa.
Marine tourism has brought people from all around the world into a close interaction with the ocean.
<br>
<br>
<em>Take care of our oceans and in return it will take care of us.</em>
